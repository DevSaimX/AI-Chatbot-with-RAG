In 2025, multimodal AI models represent state-of-the-art systems capable of processing and integrating multiple data modalities—chiefly text, vision (images), and audio—within a unified framework for highly contextual and interactive AI experiences. Here is an overview focusing on GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, LLaVA, and Sora, highlighting how they handle multimodal inputs and outputs:

### GPT-4o (OpenAI)
- **Modalities:** Native support for text, images, and audio inputs and outputs.
- **Capabilities:** GPT-4o integrates simultaneous processing of voice, vision, and text in real-time conversations. It supports large context windows (up to 128,000 tokens), enabling complex dialogue that blends visual cues, speech, and text seamlessly.
- **Strengths:** Highly intuitive, creative, and collaborative, with advanced understanding of multimodal context. Real-time voice-to-voice interaction is a key feature, making it suitable for natural conversational AI experiences that feel human-like.
- **Use Cases:** Multimodal chatbots, voice-activated assistants, real-time audio-visual content analysis, creative collaboration tools.

### Gemini 1.5 (Google DeepMind)
- **Modalities:** Processes text, images, audio, and video inputs.
- **Capabilities:** Gemini 1.5 extends the Gemini lineage with broader multimodal comprehension, although recently some image generation features have been paused. The model is optimized for complex reasoning tasks using multimodal inputs.
- **Strengths:** Strong in contextual understanding combining visual and auditory information with text, supporting tasks like visual question answering and multimodal reasoning.
- **Use Cases:** Multimodal search engines, content understanding, interactive AI agents.

### LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)
- **Modalities:** Focus on merging vision and language understanding.
- **Capabilities:** Designed as an open-source system, LLaVA can interpret images alongside text to answer questions about visual content or generate descriptions.
- **Strengths:** Open-source flexibility enables community-driven enhancements; excelling in visual question answering and text-image fusion tasks.
- **Use Cases:** Research, academic projects, applications requiring combined vision-language reasoning.

### Sora
- While less publicly documented than the above models, Sora is reported to be a multimodal assistant that integrates text, vision, and audio for interactive applications.
- **Capabilities:** Emphasizes real-time multimodal input processing and output generation, supporting natural user interactions across communication modes.
- **Use Cases:** Customer support AI, interactive virtual agents.

### How These Models Handle Multimodality Together
- **Encoding and Fusion:** Each modality (text, image, audio) is processed by specialized encoders converting raw data into rich vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.
- **Fusion Mechanisms:** These embeddings are then combined in a shared latent space, allowing the model to align and contextualize information across modalities dynamically.
- **Generation:** The combined representation is used in autoregressive or generative frameworks to produce coherent, contextually appropriate responses across all modalities (e.g., answering a question about an image with spoken or written language).
- **Context Window:** Large token windows (e.g., 128K tokens for GPT-4o and Gemini) facilitate long-context understanding and integration of varied inputs over dialogue or documents.

### Summary of Current Multimodal AI Landscape in 2025
- Multimodal models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 stand out for their real-time, native support of text, vision, and audio, enabling rich, multi-channel interactions previously unattainable.
- Open-source efforts like LLaVA bring multimodal AI capabilities to research and development communities, fostering customizable vision-language applications.
- Multimodal integration enables better grounding, reduces hallucinations, and supports use cases demanding synchronized attention to visual, auditory, and textual context.
- Challenges remain in computational cost and system complexity, but advances continue to push usability in enterprise, creative, and consumer domains.
