OpenAI’s GPT models have seen significant evolution from GPT-1 (2018) to GPT-4o (2024/2025), with major improvements in scale, structure, and capability at every stage. Here’s a detailed chronological overview of this progression:

### GPT-1 (2018)
- **Parameters**: 117 million
- **Architecture**: 12-layer transformer, decoder-only design.
- **Key Innovations**:
  - Introduced the concept of *generative pre-training* on large text corpora followed by *supervised fine-tuning* for specific NLP tasks.
  - Trained on BookCorpus (over 7,000 books), emphasizing coherent text generation and context handling.
- **Limitations**:
  - Limited model size meant its results, while a leap forward, did not scale well for complex tasks.
  - Performance was strong compared to previous models but not robust for most practical applications.[1][2][3][4]

### GPT-2 (2019)
- **Parameters**: 1.5 billion (10x GPT-1)
- **Major Upgrades**:
  - Vastly increased scale and dataset size (8 million web pages, 40GB+ of text).
  - Much stronger language modeling, next-token prediction, and generation quality.
  - Large dataset allowed capturing broader language subtleties but still struggled with long-form coherence.
- **New Capabilities**:
  - Demonstrated impressive performance in text generation, translation, question answering, and summarization.
- **Caution**: OpenAI initially withheld full model release due to concerns about disinformation and misuse; model later made fully public.[5][6][7][1]

### GPT-3 (2020)
- **Parameters**: 175 billion (over 100x GPT-2)
- **Breakthroughs**:
  - Introduced *few-shot learning*: could perform new tasks with only a handful of example prompts.
  - Excelled in diverse applications: code generation, language translation, creative and factual content writing, question answering, and more.
- **Products**: Powered the OpenAI API and services like ChatGPT; public access via private beta to manage safety and scaling.
- **Challenges**:
  - Model performance could be unpredictable, with issues in factual accuracy, reasoning, and social bias.
  - Opaque and difficult to interpret reasoning process, enhanced concerns about AI alignment.[8][7][9][5][1]

### GPT-3.5 (2022/2023)
- **Parameters**: Not directly disclosed, believed in the same range as GPT-3 but with architectural and data improvements.
- **Enhancements**:
  - Better performance on chat-completion tasks (used for ChatGPT).
  - Enhanced conversational capabilities, improved robustness, and lower hallucination rates.
  - Released *gpt-3.5-turbo* in 2023; became foundation for widespread public use on ChatGPT.[8]

### GPT-4 (2023)
- **Parameters**: Not officially announced, rumored between 1–2 trillion.
- **Major Features**:
  - **Multimodal**: Can process text and images (GPT-4V/4-vision).
  - Large context window: up to 128,000 tokens.
  - Marked improvements in factual accuracy, reasoning, coding ability, and multilingual support. Scored **88.7** on the challenging MMLU benchmark, outpacing earlier models.[10][11]
  - Fine-tuned with human feedback for safer and more aligned AI outputs.
- **Use in Products**: Powered ChatGPT Plus; API access for developers.

### GPT-4o ("Omni", 2024/2025)
- **Release**: May 2024 (main version), with updates and *GPT-4o Mini* following in July 2024.
- **Key Upgrades**:
  - **Natively Multimodal**: Processes text, images, and *audio* in real-time; voice-to-voice capabilities.
  - **Advanced Language Support**: Over 50 languages supported, covering more than 97% of global speakers.
  - Larger context window (128K tokens), more efficient tokenization (especially for non-Latin scripts).
  - Even higher MMLU score (88.7), outperforming previous models.
  - **Corporate Customization**: Businesses can fine-tune GPT-4o with proprietary data for custom solutions.
  - **Knowledge Base**: Trained on data up to October 2023, with internet access as-needed for up-to-date facts.
  - **Improvements**: More intuitive, creative, collaborative, better at math, coding, vision, and following complex instructions.[12][13][14][1]
- **Deployment**: Foundation model for ChatGPT (2024–2025), with advanced voice modes and real-time APIs released later in 2024.
